          <ol>
            <li><strong>Fun.</strong>Taco Bowls are a fun and different way to enjoy a taco.<br>
              Tacos were pretty much a weekly menu item when I was a kid.  My mom made them with ground beef and served them<br>
              in those crispy taco shells. </li>
            <li><strong>Delicious.</strong>So many good flavors and textures all in one place<br>
              Just mix it up and enjoy!</li>
            <li><strong>Easy.</strong>They are easy to put together and It is a great way to<br>
              use up leftover meat you may have on hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable.</strong>Everyone can create their own combination<br>
            using their favorite toppings.</li>
            <li><strong>Meal Prepping.</strong>Because everything can be prepped ahead, it’s<br>
              the perfect make ahead meal.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="whats-in-a-taco-bowl">What is in a Taco Bowl?</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Meat.</strong>For today’s version I used ground beef cooked with taco<br>
              seasoning. You could also use ground chicken or ground turkey.</li>
            <li><strong>Taco Seasoning.</strong>You can use store bought seasoning but it’s easy<br>
              to make a homemade taco seasoning using your own using garlic<br>
              powder, onion power, chili powder, cumin, oregano, and paprika.<br>
              I’ve got a recipe down below for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice.</strong>Use brown rice or white rice, whatever your preference is.</li>
            <li><strong>Toppings.</strong>This is where you can go crazy and add your favorite<br>
              taco toppings.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="How-to-make-taco-bowl">How to Make a Taco Bowl.</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Rice.</strong>Start with a base of brown rice. You can use white rice<br>
              or even Mexican rice.  Follow my directions for making<br>
              perfect Instant Pot brown rice every time. We like to use the<br>
              rice warm. You can also substitute quinoa for rice if you<br>
              prefer or use cauliflower rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Meat.</strong>For beef taco meat, brown hamburger and add in taco<br>
              seasoning ingredients or a store bought taco seasoning.<br>
              Simmer for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add</strong> your meat on top of the rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Beans.</strong>Drain and rinse your black beans. You can also use<br>
              pinto beans or refried beans.</li>
            <li><strong>Corn.</strong>I usually used canned corn but you can also use corn<br>
              cut fresh off the cob if it is in season. Drain the canned corn.<br>
              To give the corn a bit more flavor char it in a cast iron pan for<br>
              a few minutes before adding it to your bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Toppings.</strong>Add your toppings from the list below.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="fav-toppings">Taco Bowl Favorite Toppings.</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Cheese.</strong>We like grated cheddar cheese but you can also use<br>
              a Mexican blend, Monterey Jack or even a Pepper Jack cheese<br>
              for a little kick.</li>
            <li><strong>Lettuce.</strong>Romaine lettuce works well or even some iceberg. I<br>
              like a lettuce with a little crunch to it. It adds nice texture to<br>
              the bowl</li>
            <li><strong>Salsa or Pico de gallo.</strong>You could also use some chopped<br>
              tomatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Guacamole.</strong>Sometimes I just add slices of avocado too.</li>
            <li><strong>Cilantro.</strong>Garnish the top of everything with some freshly<br>
              chopped cilantro.</li>
            <li><strong>Taco sauce, hot sauce or ketchup.</strong>Drizzle this over the top.<br>
              As a kid I always had to have ketchup on my tacos!</li>
            <li><strong>Tortilla Chips.</strong>You can add some tortilla chips too if you like<br>
              for a little extra crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Sour Cream</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Red Onions</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong></li>
          </ol>
