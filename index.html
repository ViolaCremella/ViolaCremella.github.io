<h1>ViolaCremella's Recipe Book</h1>



<h2>What is ViolaCremella's Recipe Book?</h2>

<p>ViolaCremella's Recipe Book is just a digital recipe book made by ViolaCremella.Its in the name ya know.This website was inspired by one of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy's</a> projects, Recipe Book.I, ViolaCremella,
will be adding more recipes, when I feel like it of course.The recipe's are NOT original though.At the bottom of each recipie webpage, there will be a link linking to where I found the recipe.</p>

<h2>How do I use this website?</h2>

<p>Well how would you use a regular recipe book????????You just follow the recipe, there should be no confusion.And again, these are not my recipes.If you have any issues or concerns, please contact <strong>the original creator of these recipes.</strong></p>
